# 7_Wonders-website

--- I incorporated the following features for this project ---

--- Graphic Content Preparation ---

Using PhotoShop,
I created (and implemented) a .png FAVICON,
processed and sized picture elements and saved them as .jpg files,
and created "chapter buttons" and saved them as .png files.

--- CSS ---

The "chapter button" images with anchors move to the left on hover.
Text links change color on hover.

(And lots of things also move around and resize for different media sizes.)

--- JavaScript ---

JavaScript was used in two places.
It is included in the functionality of the "hamburger icon",
and in the data handling in the Email Sign-up box on the "contacts.html" page.

--- extra credit ---

I also embedded a video, linked to Vimeo, on the "video.html" page that scales with the size of the browser window.

--- Media Queries ---

For mobile up to 600px,
   all content in arranged in a single column, and the nav bar has a "hamburger selector".

For tablets from 601px to 768px,
   the nav bar switches to text links.

For screens 769px and up,
   the "chapter buttons" in the aside box at the bottom move from the bottom to the right side.
